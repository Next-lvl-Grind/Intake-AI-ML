# 🧠 AI/ML Learning Journey - Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning journey! 🚀

## 📅 Date
`July 4, 2025`

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Types of Machine Learning:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
- Real-world applications of AI/ML
- Setting up the Python environment (Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code)
- Installed essential libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- VS Code
- Terminal

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Read about AI vs ML vs Deep Learning
- Installed required Python packages
- Wrote a simple `Hello AI World!` Python script
- Explored datasets from `scikit-learn`

## 📌 Notes
- **AI** is the broader concept, **ML** is a subset.
- Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised doesn't.
- Reinforcement learning involves rewards and actions.

## 🧪 Sample Code

```python
# hello_ai.py
print("Hello AI World!")
